The CSS `calc()` function can produce unexpected results if you're not careful with operator precedence and unit handling. For example, `width: calc(100% - 10px);` works as expected, but `width: calc(100% - 10);` will likely fail because the second term lacks units.  Another issue arises when combining different units within the `calc()` function without proper conversion.  Incorrect use of parentheses can also cause unexpected behavior.
